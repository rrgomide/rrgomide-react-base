# rrgomide-react-base
An app created with create-react-app and some other things so I can start from scratch with a little basic scaffolding.

It includes:

+ create-react-app (CRA)
+ Tailwind CSS
+ craco (needed by tailwind to work with CRA)
+ react-i18n (app strings in English ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ and Brazilian Portuguese ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡·)
+ react-router
+ A useCounter hook
